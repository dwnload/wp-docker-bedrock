# Roots Bedrock for WordPress running on Docker

This is a Docker based local development environment for WordPress with Roots Bedrock.

## What's Inside

This project is based on [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). By default, the following containers are
started: PHP-FPM, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, nginx, and Memcached. The `/site/web` directory is the web root which is
mapped to the nginx container. See [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) for more info.


## Docs from [10up/wp-docker](https://github.com/10up/wp-docker)
You can directly edit PHP, nginx, and Elasticsearch configuration files from within the repo as they are mapped to
the correct locations in containers.

A `Dockerfile` is included for PHP-FPM (`/dockerfiles/php-fpm/Dockerfile`). This adds a few extra things to the
PHP-FPM image.

The `/config/elasticsearch/plugins` folder is mapped to the plugins folder in the Elasticsearch container. You can
drop Elasticsearch plugins in this folder to have them installed within the container.

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Setup

1. `git clone git@github.com:dwnload/wp-docker-bedrock.git <my-project-name>`
1. `cd <my-project-name>`
1. `docker-compose up`
1. Run `bash ./bin/setup.sh` to download Bedrock.

Default MySQL connection information (from within PHP-FPM container):

```
Database: wordpress
Username: wordpress
Password: password
Host: mysql
```

Default Elasticsearch connection information (from within PHP-FPM container):

```Host: http://elasticsearch:9200```

## Docker Compose Overrides File

Adding a `docker-compose.override.yml` file alongside the `docker-compose.yml` file, with contents similar to
the following, allows you to change the domain associated with the cluster while retaining the ability to pull in changes from the repo.

```
version: '2'
services:
  phpfpm:
    extra_hosts:
      - "dashboard.dev:172.18.0.1"
```

## WP-CLI

Add this alias to `~/.bash_profile` to easily run WP-CLI command.

```
alias dcwp='docker-compose exec --user www-data phpfpm wp'
```

Instead of running a command like `wp plugin install` you instead run `dcwp plugin install` from anywhere inside the
`<my-project-name>` directory, and it runs the command inside of the php container.

There is also a script in the `/bin` directory that will allow you to execute WP CLI from the project directory directly: `./bin/wp plugin install`.

## SSH Access

You can easily access the WordPress/PHP container with `docker-compose exec`. Here's a simple alias to add to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```
alias dcbash='docker-compose exec --user root phpfpm bash'
```

This alias lets you run `dcbash` to SSH into the PHP/WordPress container.

Alternatively, there is a script in the `/bin` directory that allows you to SSH in to the environment from the project directory directly: `./bin/ssh`.

## Credits

This project is our own flavor of an environment created by the 10up team based on work by John Bloch. Some additional
code was used from easypath/bedrock-docker.
